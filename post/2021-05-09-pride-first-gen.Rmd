# Proud First Gen Student

I will be graduating this may with a BSA in biology as a first generation student! Below I will be using the reticulate package to code in both R and python.


```{R}
library(reticulate)
This_year_was_awful <- "I am a"
Senior_year_was <- "I am so very greatful to"
```

```{python}
I_cannot_believe_I_surived = "proud first generation student!"
absolutely_insane = "all my friends and family who helped me along the way!"
print(r.This_year_was_awful, I_cannot_believe_I_surived)
```

```{R}
cat(c(Senior_year_was,py$absolutely_insane))
```
