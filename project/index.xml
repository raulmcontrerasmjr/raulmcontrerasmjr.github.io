      <description>0. Introduction Three datasets were used for this project. Two datasets are both from a Global Burden of Disease study. The data titled “deathprop,” is the probability of death based off of region and year including shocks. Shocks are estimates include deaths from natural disasters, wars, etc. The “noshocks,” dataset includes the death probability estimates without deaths from these shocks. Both of these datasets include variables on year, state, value, upper, and lower.</description>
